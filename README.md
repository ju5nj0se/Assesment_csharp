## General Description of the System

The San Vicente Hospital system is a web application developed with ASP.NET Core MVC that facilitates the management of medical appointments between doctors and patients.  
Its main goal is to streamline the administration of medical encounters (creation, viewing, updating, and deletion of appointments) and optimize the organization of information within the hospital.

The system allows:

- Managing doctors and patients (create, list, update, and delete).
- Scheduling new medical appointments between both.
- Validating availability to avoid appointment overlaps.
- Filtering appointments by doctor or patient ID.
- Managing appointment statuses: Pending, Attended, Canceled.

The primary role interacting with the system is the **Administrator**, who has full control over the management of medical appointments.
